Installation
============

FlippyDrive has a solderless installation process and can be used with or without the disc drive. Watch out for the notes in this section to make the install process as easy as possible.

Things Required
```````````````

- 5-10 Minutes
- FlippyDrive kit (FlippyDrive, flex, mounting frame, drive plug, two screws)
- 4.5mm Gamebit screwdriver
- #0 Phillips screwdriver
- #1 Phillips screwdriver (optional)
- #2 Phillips screwdriver

Step 1: Open the cube
`````````````````````

Remove the 4 Gamebit screws

Flip the gamecube rightside up, remove and set aside the lid

Set aside the rear IO shield and let the front IO shield dangle.  

.. note::
    It is not necessary to detach the front IO panel. You may do so, but time will be lost and must be set on first boot.

Using a #2 Phillips, remove the 10 RF shield screws

Tilt and let the fan/power connector assembly rest loose. It remains attached to the cube during this process.  Remove the 4 previously obscured screws.

Using a #1 or #0 Phillips, remove the 4 memory card RF-finger screws

With one hand holding the base of the cube, grab the drive and pull it upward, freeing the drive and RF shield from the cube motherboard

At this point, your gamecube will be disassembled, hooray  ðŸŽ‰

Step 2: Prepare FlippyDrive
```````````````````````````

Fold the flex along the perforation as seen below. When viewing the flex, make sure the fold along the perforation results in the crease pointing "upward" like a 'W' on the side of the flex with a triangle symbol.

.. note::    
    The flex is quite forgiving to excessive force, but it is undesirable to form a sharp fold. As long as it can seat into the connector, it will function.

Gently place the flex into the disc drive slot.

    :width: 100%

Verify that the flex is folded correctly and is not upside down. The long arm of the flex will be between the disc connector and the heatsink.

Now fold the flex down such that it sits between the disc connector and heatsink and is no longer on top of the heatsink.

Step 2a: With Disc Drive
------------------------

Inspect your disc drive. The FlippyDrive flex will be escaping from under the shield on the "front right" corner if viewing the drive from the front.

.. note:: 
    Some of the sheet metal RF shields were over-aggressively folded. If necessary, bend the shield very slightly back into square to restore the gap that should exist.

.. image:: _static/4X1A7515.jpg

Back on the gamecube, route the flex between the nearby small and large plastic mounting pillars

.. image:: _static/4X1A7514.jpg
    :width: 100%

Gently lower the drive assembly down onto the cube, and snake the flex though the slot in the folded sheet metal shield. Once the flex is in the proper position, push the drive downward.

.. danger::    
    It only takes approximately 10lb (5kg) of force to mate the drive to the cube. If you encounter more resistance, don't force it. Stop, remove the drive, and inspect the flex placement. The flex is fairly tear resistant, but not if you put your entire body weight on it.

The mounting frame covers one of the screw holes, so put 1 of the RF shield screws into the provided storage hole

Step 2b: Without Disc Drive
---------------------------

Use the provided drive plug and push straight down onto the flex and connector until it stops.

.. attention::    
    If you need to remove the drive plug for any reason, pull it up from both sides simultaneously and do not aggressively rock it from side to side. Doing so may break off the alignment tabs inside the connector. If that happens, use tweasers to reach underneath the broken plastic to pull it upward.  The drive plug will still work with broken alignment tabs, although you will need to be more careful about left-right placement.

Step 3: Install the FlippyDrive
```````````````````````````````

Inspect the flippydrive. Check the flex connector locking tab and make sure it is in the unlocked/up position.

Attach mounting frame to the gamecube with two of the RF shield screws

.. image:: _static/4X1A7528.jpg
    :width: 100%

Check the orientation of the flex and line up so the two triangles are on the same side.  Attach the flex to flippydrive, pushing it in until it reaches a hard stop, and push closed the locking tab. When locked, the black locking tab will be flush with the body of the connector.

.. note::
    Attaching the flex to the flippydrive after mounting to the frame is quite difficult, so it is recommended to attach flex first, then flippydrive to frame

Using a #0 Phillips, attach flippydrive to frame using the two provided screws

Step 4: Verify Installation
```````````````````````````

.. warning::    
    If you removed the front panel/controller board, time will be lost and you must set the clock. After setting the clock, power cycle the cube to proceed.

Connect the gamecube to a display and power on the cube while holding ``X``. It is safe to run the gamecube without a fan for quite some time. You should see the flippydrive bootloader, which means the install was successful!

You may safely turn off the cube at any point during the update process with no risk of a brick.

Step 5: Reassemble Cube
```````````````````````

Follow the instructions in Step 1 in reverse.

.. danger::
    Make sure your disc lid is **open** before reassembly. Attaching it when closed can damage the door cover switch.

.. note::
    If you did not remove the front controller panel during disassembly, make sure its flex cable it is still fully seated on the gamecube motherboard
    
.. note::
    Don't forget to install the 4 screws normally hidden by the fan/power connector assembly before placing it back on
