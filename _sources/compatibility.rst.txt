Game Compatibility
******************

Having just entered beta, the FlippyDrive currently has a few thousand hours of total game runtime.  Compatibility has been excellent overall with a handful of third-party titles revealing a few minor bugs in our drive emulation that have since been fixed.  Below is the list of GameCube titles, and their status with various loading modes.

.. important::
    We do not yet have automated status reporting, so we rely on `viewers like you` to report game compatibility, especially positive reports
    If you try a game and see it works correctly, please `let us know here <https://forms.gle/Qdr2Fx8JbchLmhBKA>`_!
