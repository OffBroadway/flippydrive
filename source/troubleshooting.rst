During FlippyDrive install
``````````````````````````

- **The flex cable doesn't reach the FlippyDrive**

  This can happen if you skip :ref:`this step <fpcfold>` or if the flex cable unfolds when placing the drive. Take the drive off if installed, verify the flex cable is still properly tucked between the drive/plug and heat sink, then try again.
  Once the drive/plug is in place, you can gently pull on the flex cable to test the slack length.


- **The GameCube shows an error ('An error has occurred.') with the FlippyDrive connected / the bootloader menu doesn't launch after installing**

  Please check if the flex cable is correctly inserted into the drive connector. Make sure you folded it correctly into a W-like shape with the gold connectors of the flex cable inserted in the middle section of the connector.

First Boot
``````````

- **I see the bootloader on first boot/pressing X but get a black screen after**

  Your connection to the cube is fully working. The flex cable and nearly all of the FlippyDrive hardware is exercised to get to this point.
      
  Make sure you're :doc:`running the latest software<updates>`. This is almost certainly a software bug and the details of your cube/install should be reported `to the issue tracker <https://github.com/OffBroadway/flippydrive/issues>`_ or `customer support <https://help.teamoffbroadway.com/portal>`_.
