FTP
==============
.. versionadded:: 1.4.3

Make sure the GUI App is open on your desktop before turning on your GameCube. Hold ``X`` to get to the FlippyDrive
bootloader, then select an on-board DOL file called `remote`. This app will start the FTP connection. You can then
use your favorite FTP client to connect to the IP address specified in the app.
