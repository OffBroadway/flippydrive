Ethernet
********

.. todo:: This page is still work-in-progress.
  There's currently not a toggle yet to switch between Ethernet and Wi-Fi, for now, just unplug the cable to disable the ethernet connection.

Take a look at the :doc:`configuration file<configuration>` entries, :doc:`server<server>`, and/or :doc:`desktop app<desktop>` required to use Ethernet.
