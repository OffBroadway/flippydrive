Other Mod Compatibility
=======================

Power
`````

The FlippyDrive consumes very little power in SD card mode, and much more in WiFi mode, but still less than the drive. It also enters a lower power state during drive bypass. 

While all cubes tested had sufficient power margins to run the FlippyDrive and disc drive simultaneously for disc ripping purposes, many mods consume large amounts of power without consideration on how it may affect other mods.

As the FlippyDrive is a net negative power consumer vs operating the disc drive, we have not noticed any power-related compatibility issues. If you are building a heavily modded gamecube, keep in mind the cube has a very limited power budget and many mods are designed with little regards to how they may interfere electrically.

We will update this with more information as we receive reports.
