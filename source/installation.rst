Installation
============

FlippyDrive has a solderless installation process and can be used with or without the disc drive. Watch out for the notes in this section to make the install process as easy as possible.

Things Required
```````````````
- 5-10 Minutes
- FlippyDrive kit (FlippyDrive, flex, mounting frame, drive plug, two screws)
- 4.5mm Gamebit screwdriver
- #0 Philips screwdriver
- #1 Philips screwdriver
- #2 Philips screwdriver

Step 1: Open the cube
`````````````````````

Remove the 4 Gamebit screws
---------------------------

Remove the N RF shield screws
-----------------------------

Remove the 3 hidden screws
--------------------------

Remove the 4 memory card RF finger screws

With one hand holding the base of the cube, grab the drive and pull it upward, freeing the drive and RF shield from the cube motherboard

Step 2: Install the FlippyDrive
```````````````````````````````

Fold the flex along the perforared shape as seen below. Make sure the fold along the perforation is {todo} relative to the long arm of the flex as seen below.

Gently place the flex into the disc drive slot.

Verify that the flex is folded correctly and is not upside down. The long arm of the flex will be between the disc connector and the heatsink.

Step 2a: With Disc Drive
------------------------

Hold the disc drive slightly above the connector and cube, then snake the flex though the slot in the folded sheet metal shield

Attach mounting framt to gamecube

Place space screw in mounting frame

Attach flex to flippydrive

..note::
    Attaching the flex to the flippydrive after mounting to the frame is quite difficult, so it is recomended to attach flex first, then flippydrive to frame

Attach flippydrive to frame

Step 2b: Without Disc Drive
---------------------------

Use the provided drive plug and push straight down onto the flex and connector until it stops.

.. note::
    If you need to remove the drive plug for any reason, pull straight up and do not rock it from side to side. Doing so may break the alignment tabs off inside the connector. If that happens, use tweasers to reach underneath the broken plastic to pull it upward.  The drive plug will still work with broken alignment tabs, although you will need to be more careful about left-right placement.

Step 3: Verify Installation
```````````````````````````

Connect the gamecube to a display and power on the cube while holding X. It is safe to run the gamecube without a fan for quite some time. You should see the flippydrive bootloader, which means the install was successful!

You may safely turn off the cube at any point during the update process with no risk of a brick.

.. note::

    Having issues, see the :doc:`troubleshooting` section

Step 4: Reassemble Cube
```````````````````````

Follow the instructions in Step 2 in reverse.  Don't forget to install the 3 screws normally hidden by the fan/power connector assembly before placing it back on
