Wi-Fi
*****

The FlippyDrive has onboard Wi-Fi for management, updates, and experimental support for loading games live.  All of this is accomplished with the FlippyDrive application.

.. note: Only 2.4 GHz (Wi-Fi 4) networks are supported due to hardware limitations.

Take a look at the :doc:`configuration file<configuration>` entries, :doc:`server<server>`, and/or :doc:`desktop app<desktop>` required to use Wi-Fi.
