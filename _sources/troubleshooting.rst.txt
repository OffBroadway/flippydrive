During Install
``````````````

1. My flex doesn't reach the FlippyDrive:
      This can happen if you skip :ref:`this step <fpcfold>` or if the flex unfolds when placing the drive. Take the drive off if installed, verify the flex is still properly tucked between the drive/plug and heatsink, the try again.
      
      Once the drive/plug is in place, you can gently pull on the flex to test the slack as it is somewhat forgiving

First Boot
``````````

1. I see the bootloader on first boot/pressing ``X`` but get a black screen after:
      Your connection to the cube is fully working. To see the bootloader on screen, the flex and nearly all of the FlippyDrive hardware is exercised. This is almost certainly a software bug and the details of your cube/install should be reported `to the issue tracker <https://github.com/OffBroadway/flippydrive/issues>`_ or `customer support <https://help.teamoffbroadway.com/portal>`_.
