Ethernet
********

.. todo:: This page is still work-in-progress.

.. caution:: 2025-09-29: This guide is not 100% complete yet. As of beta version 1.4.6 - if you want to switch from Ethernet back to WiFi again, you'll have to unplug the Ethernet add-on ribbon cable at either end. It will be possible in a future software update to toggle between the two.

Take a look at the :doc:`configuration file<configuration>` entries, :doc:`server<server>`, and/or :doc:`desktop app<desktop>` required to use Ethernet.
